About Me:
My name is Peter Nguyen. I am a Web Developer based in Orange County. I have a passion for problem solving and exploring new ideas.
I originally started my career in architecture, but during my studies and work experience I quickly found myself learning python to optimize my work flow in both
creating and documenting geometery for fabricators. I loved figuring out the patterns and logic needed to make my code function and eventually realized I needed 
to realign my interest towards web development. When i'm not programming you can find me building stuff at home with my CNC mill or 3d printer, but even then I might
be programming my machines to do the job.
